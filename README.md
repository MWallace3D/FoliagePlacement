# FoliagePlacement

This script creates a new panel in the object mode tool shelf, under the Pivot Painter tab. Includes operators to set system unit settings to match UE4 scale, create a base-mesh object oriented along X axis (for use with Pivot Painter tools), as well for generating random clusters from a source mesh object.
